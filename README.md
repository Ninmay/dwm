dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
Iosevka fonts will come in handy. Otherwise change it to your own taste.

Base changes
------------
Patches are located in the *patches* directory. Other than that, I haven't touched
config files any deeper than setting up base values.
