## @file
# Runs the file selected with fzf. The file is ran by an app chosen
# based on the file extension. It's different than frun, because it
# starts the search from the working directory and is of depth 0.
# If there's a program you would explicitly like to use, pass it
# as argument. For example: fwalk vim.
