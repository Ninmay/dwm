## @file
# frun-comp means frun, but compact.
# Runs the file selected with fzf. The file is ran by an app chosen
# based on the file extension. It's different than frun, because it
# starts the search from the working directory.

# If there's a program you would explicitly like to use, pass it
# as argument. For example: fr vim.
